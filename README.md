# Application Tracker

This project is a simple application tracker, developed in Java using Spring Boot. It allows users
to add and remove applications from their list of tracked apps, as well as view the details
of each app. The main features include:

1. User authentication with JWT tokens for secure access control.
2. A RESTful API that provides endpoints to manage user accounts, add/remove applications,
   and retrieve information about an individual's applications.
3. Use Handlebars.js as the template engine.
4. Implement pagination on the home page.
5. Include unit tests for all components of the application.
6. Have both GET and POST routes for retrieving and adding new data.
